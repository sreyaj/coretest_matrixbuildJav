This is Sample Java project with Jacoco reports
 


###Test Cases that are covered in CI build triggering manually:


1. Matrix build    
     -  when we trigger sample_jacocomatrix project,it will have 3 matrix build 

2. User specified env variable in env tag    
     -  In this project there is one userspecified env( - env=test1 )  mentioned in env tag
   
3. Matrix.include version + user specified env vars     
     - have included one more version openjdk7 along with the env : foo=fubu in matrix. include tag
       env: foo=fubu
4. Matrix.exclude version + user specified env vars 
      - Here we exclude version - jdk: oraclejdk8 with env=test1

5. Matrix.allow_failure version     
   - version oraclejdk7 fails in build ci because of this - if [ "$SHIPPABLE_JDK_VERSION" == "oraclejdk7" ]; then foobar; fi
     so we allow failure for this version 

6. Submodule public    
   - Added public submodule sampleNod which is there in shiptest-rc-ow 
     so whenever sample_jacocomatrix  completes triggering in gitsync we should able to see the submodules sampleNod

7. event trigger project webhook(see payload shows correctly in all cases )    
    - we have set on_start : always,on_success:always where when sample_jacoccomatrix starts  triggering the project webhhook (sampleNod project will  trigger) check payload given in sample_jacoccomatrix is shown in the sampleNod for on_start and on_success build 

8. event trigger issue creation(check payload shows correctly)    
    - on_start: always on_success: always , when sample_jacocomatrix builds starts and completes triggering in project(sampleNod) will have issue get created on (on_success and on_start) with the payload given in the sample_jacocomatrix
9. download job consoles(verify there is no build script and secure envs)    
     - when build completes triggering click on download job console from runs page
10. coverage reports    
    - check wheather the coverage report is showing properly 
11. coverage badge
    - check coverage bdge shows properly in github project page properly, when we click on covergae badge it should take us to project dashboard page
    
12. download coverage report    
    - from coverage tab details click on download 
    
13. check default pull image (drydock) 

14. Unstable status    
     - status of the build will be unstable because we have set low coverage alert with unstable status
     
15. Low coverage alert    
     - set low coverage alert below some range with unstable status from project setting->runsConfig, then when coverage report        goes below that range we will receive notification based on the notification we have configured in yml
     we will receive notification in following 

     email:  - shiptest.rc.ow@gmail.com ,
             - shiptest.rc.me@gmail.com

     irc:    - "chat.freenode.net#testrc-irc" , 
             - "chat.freenode.net#testalpha-irc"

 ###Test Cases that are covered when we trigger(rebuild) for 2nd time on the same repo

16. rebuild   
17. cache: true    
18. cache container    
    - cache container it cache a particular folder or file. Here we cache  - $SHIPPABLE_BUILD_DIR/shippable.yml




 ###Test Case that is covered before that we have to do following -> go to project setting and clear cache and then triggering a webhook/manual build

19. clear cache/reset minion    
    - After completing build with cache: true clear cache from project settings-options page and then trigger the project again 
     it should not cache the build which cached before     
     
 ###tag and release build 
     
20. Tag build from ui 
    - create a tag build , when we create a tag  from github ui (even if dont give release name )it will trigger          both tag and release build with tag name given    
21. Release build from github ui
